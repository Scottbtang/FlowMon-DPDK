# FlowMon-DPDK
A DPDK software traffic monitor for per-flow statistics. We aim at providing the detailed statistics on both packet level and flow level. Specifically, FlowMon-DPDK aims at providing per-flow throughput, inter-packet gap and percentiles. In this repository, we test different models to obtain the best performance.
